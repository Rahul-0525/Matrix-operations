# Matrix-operations
A simple python file to do matrix operations on square matrix<br>

The python file uses basic functions, nested loops, dictionaries and list to create and represent the matrix and do the operations on them. While there runs a while loop which is used to provide the operation menu to the user and can easily be exited.<br>

The working:

1. The program asked for the order of the square matrix
2. Then it asks for the rows two matrix to create two complete matrixes
3. The loop start running after it providing the user with options of operations that can be done between the matrixes which are : 1. Add 2.Subtract 3.Multiplication 4.Exit
4. It prints do all the calculations by calling the respected functions according to the operations
5. and finally show the output in a clean matrix format


   Later it can be made better by adding the feature of be able to do the operation on the non square matrix. The feature like finding the inverse, transpose, adjacent of a single matrix input can also be added.
