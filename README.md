# Matrix-operations
A simple python file to do matrix operations on square matrix<br>

The python file uses basic functions, nested loops, dictionaries and list to create and represent the matrices and to do  operations on them. While there runs a while loop which provide the operation menu to the user and can easily be exited.<br>

The working:

1. The program first ask the user for the order of the two square matrix on which operation are to be done.
2. Then it asks for the rows of the two matrices. To create and finally display them in the terminal.
3. The user then is provided with the options of operations that can be done between the matrixes which are : 1. Add 2. Subtract 3. Multiplication 4. Exit
4. It do all the calculations by calling the respected functions.
5. and finally show the output in a clean matrix format

## Future possible imporvements
Later it can be made better by adding the feature of operations to be done on  non-square matrices. 
The feature like finding the inverse, transpose and adjacent of a single matrix input can also be added for the same.
